The purpose of this project is to create a shiny app which displays catchment strategies and has a button to press which then creates a "Catchment Evidence Pack" markdown html doc.
The evidence packs are to be different to a dashboard as they show so many disperate strands of evidence, there needs to be a narrative provided (hence the markdown format).
River catchments are very complex natural systems and getting access to the granular data that underpins them continues to be a barrier to the EA. This workstream addresses that.
